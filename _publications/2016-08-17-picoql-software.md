title: "PiCO QL: A software library for runtime interactive queries on program data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-08-17-picoql-software
excerpt: "PiCO QL is an open source C/C++ software whose scientific scope is real-time interactive analysis of in-memory data through sql queries. It exposes a relational view of a system's or application's data structures, which is queryable through SQL. While the application or system is executing, users can input queries through a web-based interface or issue web service requests. Queries execute on the live data structures through the respective relational views. PiCO QL makes a good candidate for ad-hoc data analysis in applications and for diagnostics in systems settings. Applications of PiCO QL include the Linux kernel, the Valgrind instrumentation framework, a GIS application, a virtual real-time observatory of stellar objects, and a source code analyser."
