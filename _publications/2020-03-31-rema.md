excerpt: "Schema matching is the process of capturing correspondence between attributes of different datasets and it is one of the most important prerequisite steps for analyzing heterogeneous data collections. State-of-the-art schema matching algorithms that use simple schema- or instance-based similarity measures struggle with finding matches beyond the trivial cases. Semantics-based algorithms require the use of domain-specific knowledge encoded in a knowledge graph or an ontology. As a result, schema matching still remains a largely manual process, which is performed by few domain experts. In this paper we present the Relational Embeddings MAtcher, or REMA, for short. REMA is a novel schema matching approach which captures semantic similarity of attributes using relational embeddings: a technique which embeds database rows, columns and schema information into multidimensional vectors that can reveal semantic similarity. This paper aims at communicating our latest findings, and at demonstrating remaâ€™s potential with a preliminary experimental evaluation."
