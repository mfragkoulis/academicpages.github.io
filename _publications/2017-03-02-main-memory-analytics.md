excerpt: "This thesis studies the methods and technologies for supporting queries on main memory data and how the widespread architecture of software systems currently affects technologies. Based on the findings from the literature we develop a method and a technology to perform interactive queries on data that reside in main memory. Our approach is based on the criteria of usefulness and usability. After an overview of the programming languages that fit the data analysis we choose SQL, the standard data manipulation language for decades.
The method we develop represents programming data structures in relational terms as requires SQL. The method's implementation took place on the C and C++ programming languages because of their wide use for the development of systems and applications. The implementation expands to the development of two diagnostic tools for identifying problems in software systems through queries to main memory metadata related to their state. The overall evaluation of our approach involves its integration in three C++ software applications, in the Linux kernel, and in Valgrind, where we also perform a user study with students."
