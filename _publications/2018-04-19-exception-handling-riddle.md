title: "The exception handling riddle: an empirical study on the Android API"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-04-19-exception-handling-riddle
excerpt: "We examine the use of the Java exception types in the Android platform's Application Programming Interface (API) reference documentation and their impact on the stability of Android applications. We develop a method that automatically assesses an API's quality regarding the exceptions listed in the API's documentation. We statically analyze ten versions of the Android platform's API (14â€“23) and 3539 Android applications to determine inconsistencies between exceptions that analysis can find in the source code and exceptions that are documented. We cross-check the analysis of the Android platform's API and applications with crash data from 901,274 application execution failures (crashes). We discover that almost 10% of the undocumented exceptions that static analysis can find in the Android platform's API source code manifest themselves in crashes. Additionally, we observe that 38% of the undocumented exceptions that developers use in their client applications to handle API methods also manifest themselves in crashes. These findings argue for documenting known might-thrown exceptions that lead to execution failures. However, a randomized controlled trial we run shows that relevant documentation improvements are ineffective and that making such exceptions checked is a more effective way for improving applications' stability."
